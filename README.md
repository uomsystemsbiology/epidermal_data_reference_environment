### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Regulation of ERK-MAPK signaling in human epidermis'](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12918-015-0187-6).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   The repository for the code is at Github [here](https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/epidermal_data).

You can find more information about this research at the project page for the work [here](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/publications/human-skin-signalling/).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a virtual machine managed by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).  To use it, install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/epidermal_data_reference_environment.git
$ cd epidermal_data_reference_environment
$ vagrant up
```
This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
