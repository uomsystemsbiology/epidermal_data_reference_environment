### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Regulation of ERK-MAPK signaling in human epidermis'](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12918-015-0187-6).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   The repository for the code is at Github [here](https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/epidermal_data).

You can find more information about this research at the project page for the work [here](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/publications/human-skin-signalling/).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a live image as a bootable read-only ISO.  To use it:

- Install a virtualization tool like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then 
- Create a new virtual machine in the virtualization tool with a virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive
- Mount the ISO in the drive
- Boot the machine.  

This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
